# Psi4-OpenMM-Interface
Minimal interface between Psi4 and OpenMM that allows passing of molecular systems between each program. Additionally, some helpful tools are included such as spherical addition of solvent (because adding solvent using addSolvent in OpenMM is broken with this interface), calculation of bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and unique conformation searching.
